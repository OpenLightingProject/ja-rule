  SYS PORTS Static Functions for PORTS System Service

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    sys_ports_static.c

  Summary:
    SYS PORTS static function implementations for the Ports System Service.

  Description:
    The Ports System Service provides a simple interface to manage the ports
    on Microchip microcontrollers. This file defines the static implementation for the 
    Ports System Service.
    
  Remarks:
    Static functions incorporate all system ports configuration settings as
    determined by the user via the Microchip Harmony Configurator GUI.  It provides 
    static version of the routines, eliminating the need for an object ID or 
    object handle.
