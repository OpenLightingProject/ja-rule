 * @brief An RDM Model for a dimmer with subdevices.
 *
 * This model simulates a dimmer with different subdevices, one per dimmer
 * module. The model implements all of the PIDs from E1.37-1.
 *
 * ### Sub-devices
 *
 * The model has multiple sub-devices, that each take a single slot of DMX
 * data. The sub-devices are not contiguous.
 *
 * DMX_BLOCK_ADDRESS can be used to set the start address of all sub-devices in
 * a single operation.
 *
 * ### Dimmer Settings
 *
 * Each sub-device implements the PIDs from Section 4 of E1.37-1. To make
 * things interesting, not all sub-devices support all the dimmer curves /
 * modulation frequencies.
 *
 * ### Presets & Scenes.
 *
 * The root device provides 3 scenes. The first scene (index 1) is a factory
 * programmed scene, which can't be modified. The 2nd and 3rd scenes can be
 * 'updated' with capture preset.
 *
 * DMX_FAIL_MODE and DMX_STARTUP_MODE can be used to change the on-failure and
 * on-startup scenes.
 *
 * ### Status Messages
 *
 * Sub devices 1 & 3 will periodically queue status messages, which can be
 * collected using the STATUS_MESSAGE PID. Subdevice 3 uses a manufacturer
 * defined status_id, and the string can be retrieved with
 * STATUS_ID_DESCRIPTION. Status messages from the individual sub devices can
 * be suppressed with SUB_DEVICE_STATUS_REPORT_THRESHOLD.
 *
 * ### Lock PIN
 *
 * The root device implements the LOCK_PIN, LOCK_STATE & LOCK_STATE_DESCRIPTION
 * PIDs. Besides the unlock state (default), there are two custom states. The
 * 1st locks only the sub-devices, the 2nd locks both subdevices and the root
 * device.
 *
 * The default lock pin is 0000.
 *
 * ### Self Tests
 *
 * The root device supports two self tests. The 1st completes in 5s and
 * always passes. The 2nd takes 20s and always fails. When the test completes a
 * status message is queued.
